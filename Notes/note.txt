Utils are basically the functions or functionalities that are repeated in each and every file

db folder contains the functionalities to connect the Mongo DB that is the databse

Here, DB_NAME means the databse name which we have stored in the constants file

Until now we have learnt how to connect our server with the mongoDB databse

Higher Order Functions means the functions are basically the functions which can accept the functions as their parameter and also they can return the functions

JWT is an bearer token --- JSON Web Token
All the things related to file handling is been handled by backend engineers

Access token is generally assigned to the user who has logged in at that person has to access the data or has to made any kind of changes or to update an data and once this access token gets expired and then the person is automatically discontinued from accessing the data.
Req.body contains the data in the text format, in the body format and in the form of form
Access Token and the refresh Token are solely for protecting the users from getting hacked. We basically reverihy the deatils while letting the user login and logout

Step 1. Make the function that is the controller 
Step 2. Work on the routes path in the app file
Step 3. Work on the actual router path on the router file
